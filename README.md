# ðŸ“¡ Xenia

**Xenia** is a revolutionary project that merges server and client into a single application, creating a new, decentralized way of communicating and exchanging data.

Built in Python, Xenia is designed to function without relying on any external servers, enabling direct peer-to-peer interactions.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Server and Client in One**  
  Every instance of Xenia acts both as a server and a client at the same time.

- **Direct Communication**  
  Send and receive data directly without middlemen.

- **Decentralized Architecture**  
  No central authority or hosting services required.

- **Lightweight and Portable**  
  Easy to run on laptops, PCs, Raspberry Pi, or even microdevices.

- **Python Powered**  
  Simple to set up, modify, and extend for your own custom needs.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

Xenia instances establish direct communication links with each other, forming a decentralized, self-sufficient network.  
Each device can simultaneously:

- Accept incoming connections (server mode)
- Initiate outgoing connections (client mode)

This architecture removes the need for third-party servers or services, making the network resilient, private, and independent.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic networking permissions (open ports if needed)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/xenia.git
cd xenia
python3 main.py
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation

Detailed technical documentation and developer guides will be provided soon.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Xenia is inspired by the vision of creating a more independent, resilient, and private way of communication â€” redefining what it means to be "online".
