# ðŸ“¡ Xenia

**Xenia** is a revolutionary project that merges server and client into a single application, creating a new, decentralized way of communicating and exchanging data.

Built entirely in Python, Xenia enables direct peer-to-peer interactions without the need for external servers.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Server and Client in One**  
  Every instance of Xenia acts simultaneously as a server and a client.

- **Direct Communication**  
  Devices communicate directly, without intermediaries.

- **Decentralized Architecture**  
  No central server or third-party services required.

- **Lightweight and Portable**  
  Runs on laptops, PCs, Raspberry Pi, or similar hardware.

- **Python Powered**  
  Easy to set up, extend, and modify.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

Each Xenia node can:

- Accept incoming connections (server mode)
- Connect to other devices (client mode)

This forms a resilient, peer-to-peer network where every device is both autonomous and interconnected.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic network permissions (open ports if necessary)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Download and extract the Xenia.zip file and run this comand in the directory where you have the file

```bash
 export TK_SILENCE_DEPRECATION=1 && python3 chat_app.py
```

## ðŸ“š Documentation

Detailed documentation and developer guides will be available soon.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Xenia is designed to redefine how communication happens â€” creating direct, resilient, and serverless networks.
